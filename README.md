Demo example for Puppeteer using Github.

This is a copy of the Puppeteer implementation for Github login created by Emad Ehasan. All credits to him for this awesome work. 
Here is the medium article where this implementation is explained in detail : https://medium.com/@e_mad_ehsan/getting-started-with-puppeteer-and-chrome-headless-for-web-scrapping-6bf5979dee3e

## Changes : 

I have omitted the part where the changes are being saved in the Mongo database. I will add that part later on since I have very less understanding of Mongo DB.

## To use : 

* Clone the repository.
* Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
* Run `node index.js` to run the file tests.
